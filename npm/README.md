## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart)

The BIN Lookup API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/binlookup](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/binlookup).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

const binlookupAPI = require('@apiverve/binlookup');
const api = new binlookupAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  bin: "448590"
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  bin: "448590"
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  bin: "448590"
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```
